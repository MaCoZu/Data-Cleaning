      "Recruits to the army of orthodox Western economic science accept a twin allegiance. They swear a general empiricism in the pursuit of knowledge and, even if they would not always admit to it, a methodological individualism in the attempt to explain human behaviour. As empiricists, they are to reject the rationalist quest for necessity among truths and inevitability among events. As individualists, they are to reject the social definition of man given by medievalists and mercantilists and refurbished by Marx. In economics, the vanguard of advance, they are to work with a notion of abstract individuals, who choose among abstractly described alternatives. In epistemology they are to insist that theories are justified only by their predictive success. Neither allegiance seems to us wise. We shall argue that neo-Classical theories of economics are unsound and that they rely for defence on a Positivist theory of knowledge which is also unsound. Having sought vainly for a trustier branch of empiricism, we shall finally argue the merits of a Rationalist philosophy and a Classical or Marxian Economics.\n",

      "Our ambitions and apologies So bold a thesis needs a scholarly defence in several volumes. Each ingredient has a complex history of subtle argument and each has been studied by authorities whom we cannot hope to rival. But, if debate had to wait for a synoptic papal bull, it would never start. Besides, general judgments formed by default can be as influential as those reached by debate and the influence of empiricism, allied in economics with neo-Classical thinking, is beyond doubt. This is not to deny that empiricists and neo-Classicists have their reasons nor that general argument occurs. But we believe that methodology is usually discussed within assumptions which need to be questioned and, indeed, rejected. Lest our point be missed, we have written something of a polemic. While regretting the cost in subtlety and scholarship, we hope for enough gain in clarity to start a fight. We are also wary of the electrified wire dividing some academic disciplines.

      "ignorance. Further back, where students are taught to intermediate level, there is more interdisciplinary harmony, since standard methods of enquiry and the corpus of existing knowledge yield a united front. The doubts, modifications and limitations peculiar to each discipline are not for beginners. However diffracted the light of truth passing through the prism of the graduate student's thesis, it shines bright and steady from the textbook. It is here that economics and philosophy have joined forces. In economics a few great textbooks have ruled the classroom and tormented every generation of students since the war. These books almost all start with a section on methodology, propounding a Positivist philosophy of science. This is the influential alliance, which we propose to attack. The crucial issues for an economic theory often arise among the most complex of its implications. Nevertheless we must beg leave to ignore, for instance, the mathematical intricacies of modern neo-Classical theory. We shall not consider the existence or the stability of general equilibrium. Nor shall we worry about its Pareto optimality.1 We shall not try to unravel the third volume of Das Kapiial with matrix algebra nor to pin down the Ricardian invariant measure of value nor to expound the mysteries of 'reswitching' and 'capital reversing5 in modern Marxian-type models.2 Instead we shall be concerned with simpler matters. When dealing with neo-Classicism, we shall confine ourselves to consumer behaviour (presented in indifference curves and in simple versions of revealed preference theory) and marginalist producer behaviour in both product and factor markets. Perfect markets will not be the only ones considered, since neo-Classical thinking embraces many varieties and defines a whole system of classification for them. But although our economic questions will thus arise from the textbooks, we believe their implications to be extensive, since we hope to show that death at the roots kills the fruit on the branches. We cannot so easily, however, base our case for Classical-Marxian thought on textbooks, since relatively few exist and those, for instance in Socialist countries, are often primarily concerned with other questions.3 Instead, we shall rely on the classic writings of Ricardo and Marx and on the modern work of Piero Sraffa and Joan Robinson. Our economic analysis will be confined to the simplest and most general propositions. Our economic quarrel with neo-Classicism is, firstly, that it concentrates on market interdependence, neglecting the deeper technological interdependence, which turns out to limit the possibilities of substitution compatible with the assumed 'givens'; secondly, that it ignores institutional and especially class relationships, so misrepresenting the nature of payments to 'factors' and neglecting the economic significance of power and conflict in societies. Neither complaint is new. Hobson made the first, Marx the second and many others have added elaborations. By contrast, the ClassicalMarxian view bases itself on technological interdependence between industries and class relationships between families or persons. But this economic quarrel will not occupy the centre of the book and the first bone we wish to pick on our own account is philosophical. We dispute not only the Positivist doctrines behind orthodox methodology but also empiricism in general. Yet we do not follow those recent philosophers who therefore reject all traditional epistemology. Instead, we shall uphold a theory of knowledge assigning a crucial role to a priori knowledge, which we take to belong to the Rationalist tradition. It seems to us as true as ever that a scientific method must reflect a philosophy of science, which must reflect a theory of knowledge.\n",

      "Crucial tenets of Empiricism We begin by tracing the alliance between Positivism and Positive economics. This means addressing philosophical remarks to economists and economic remarks to philosophers. If we seem naive to those already familiar with the subtleties on both sides, we crave indulgence and, if our remarks are disconcertingly antiphonal, we urge patience. We should also confess at once that some philosophical issues we raise throughout the book no longer seem crucial to most Anglo-Saxon philosophers, at any rate in the form we give them. This is because Positivism and indeed all traditional epistemology are in eclipse at present. Our apologia is partly that the traditional philosophic problems still beset the philosophy of social science, which remains broadly empiricist, and partly that we ourselves simply do not agree that the eclipse is merited. So let us begin with a sketch of Empiricism, of which Positivism is the best-worked-out variant, and a promise to our economic readers to show it as an indispensable background to standard introductory chapters on methodology. Empiricism, is, negatively, the denial that anything can be known about the world a priori or without benefit of experience. The history of the world, as an empiricist sees it, is the story of a series of states in which there happen to be patterns. Nothing must be as it is, no event must have any particular cause, no state must be followed by any one other state. Consequently we can never know a priori what will happen next and science has to progress by generalising from experience. Logic or reasoning alone cannot tell us which of infinitely many possible worlds we live in, nor which of infinitely many possible continuations from the present state will, in fact, occur. Scientific laws and explanations could be discovered a priori, only if ours were the only possible world. Besides, all our knowledge of the world rests in the end on observation and we observe only that something is so or (if we may ignore the traditional philosophical problems about the past) was so or has always been so. We can never observe that anything must be as it is. There is, therefore, no room for the idea that causal laws are in any sense necessities in nature. We can thus pick out two crucial tenets of Empiricism: (i) claims to knowledge of the world can be justified only by experience; (ii) whatever is known by experience could have been otherwise. It is tempting to add a third, that no statement about the objective world depends for its truth on whether it is believed. This certainly accords with most versions of Empiricism (and of Rationalism for that matter) and embodies the common view that human beings cannot make an empirical statement true by fiat. But it is rejected by Pragmatism, which we shall later present as the newest champion of Empiricism. So, although the usual distinction between belief and knowledge is part of the philosophical orthodoxy taught to apprentices, we cannot list it as definitive of Empiricism. Empiricist philosphy of science cannot allow that there is any necessity about causal connections. Malthus' laws of population, for instance, even if genuine, cannot be treated as iron laws in the sense that they reveal what is bound to happen or that statements of them cannot be denied without contradiction. We have to be able to observe instances of causal connections. Accordingly, the notion of Cause is analysed (usually) in a way derived from Hume. At its simplest, to say that A causes B is to say that/1 is always followed by B in given conditions. This takes us a step beyond mere observation but an inductive licence to generalise from observed correlations to universal ones does not offend the empiricist's insistence on the primacy of observation. Generalisations can be tested by observing whether suitable instances actually occur. There can be no basic difference in kind between causal laws and confirmed empirical generalisations, even if the title of 'law' is reserved for generalisations especially broad, useful, elegant or suggestive. This may prompt the objection that the citing of causal laws is supposed to explain, whereas generalisations merely describe. The empiricist replies that there is no ultimate basis for such a distinction. To explain an event, it is enough to cite confirmed generalisations from which the occurrence of the event could have been predicted. Prediction is our only weapon but it suffices and to predict is to explain in advance. Induction is the only coin which buys knowledge of what lies beyond direct observation. Since it is the only coin, prediction and explanation have to be two sides of it. To predict is to deduce an instance from a generalisation; to explain is to cover an instance with a generalisation.\n",

      "The analytic—synthetic distinction and Positivist method The last paragraph can serve as a rough account of the core of nineteenthcentury Positivism. The idea still retains all its importance but has become embedded in a more forceful and elegant Logical Positivism, best introduced as a theory about the meaning and truth of statements.4 All claims to knowledge can be treated as claims to know that a statement is true. The advance of science now becomes the progressive determination of the truth or falsity of statements. This may seem an artificial way of putting it but it clears the deck for the introduction of that great engine of Logical Positivist epistemology, the analytic-synthetic distinction. A logical positivist holds that all cognitively meaningful statements are of just two exclusive kinds, analytic or synthetic. Very roughly, the former are statements of language, the latter statements of fact. More formally, a true statement is analytic, if it cannot be denied without contradiction or if its truth arises from the meanings of its terms; it is synthetic, if there are possible circumstances in which it would be (or would have been) false. For example, the statement that 'if the elasticity of demand is greater than unity, then a reduction in the price of a good will lead to an increase in total expenditure on the good' is analytic. For, were the total expenditure to fall, then it would follow logically not that the statement was false but that the elasticity of demand was not greater than unity. This is a mere consequence of our defining terms like 'elasticity of demand' as we do and does not reveal some grand causal law about the working of the economy. On the other hand, the statement that 'if investment is increased, there will be a rise in employment' is (in the absence of any theoretical proof of it) synthetic. It is no less a universal statement but whether it is true depends on observation and induction and there is no logical contradiction in denying it. It states a relation which holds (if it does) as a matter of fact and so does claim to express a causal law. This analytic-synthetic distinction guards an apparently weak flank of Empiricism. For it seems at first sight that logic alone can sometimes tell us which of infinitely many possible worlds we live in, in the sense that some truths are both necessarily true and informative about our world. For instance, that certain relations hold under imperfect competition appears to be a fact about a type of market for which no empirical evidence is needed, since the theorist can prove it a priori. If this interpretation were accepted, it would follow at once that experience is not always needed to justify claims to knowledge of the world. So an empiricist who admits that there are necessary or a priori truths must add that they do not state empirical facts. He does so by insisting that they are analytic and therefore not synthetic. This involves him, as we shall see later, in three further and separate claims about analytic truths — that they are linguistic, that they are man-made and that they make no empirical assertions. All three claims can be (and will be) disputed but, while they stand, they serve to protect the basic tenets of Empiricism from refutation by the existence of necessary truths. This view of analytic truths is so crucial to logical positivism that it is worth spelling out how it arises. The root question concerns the relation of a priori and empirical in human knowledge or, for present purposes, the relation of pure theory to fact. Can pure theorising discover truths to which experience is bound to conform (on pain of being dismissed as misleading)? Empiricists are bound to say, No. The denial can be made by refusing to recognise a class of a priori truths at all, but this is not the logical positivists' way. Logical positivists have a positive use for a priori truths, once rendered harmless. So they contend that a priori truths make no empirical assertions. But this is not self-evident and reasons must be given for accepting it. So the next move is to deny that theorising is a process of discovery. Again, however, this is not self-evident - psychologically indeed it is plainly false. So, to give epistemological justification, systems of pure theory are construed by analogy with languages, the meanings of whose terms depend on the semantic rules for combining them. As typically with the theorems of logic, a priori truths are deemed to result from the definitions and rules of the systems in which they occur. Even so, however, more needs to be said, since, were these rules immutable in any important sense, truths resulting from them would reveal at least immutable ways of conceptualising and ordering experience and even perhaps immutable features of the experience ordered. So it has to be shown both that a priori truths have as subject matter not things but concepts and that the rules they depend on are mutable. It has to be shown that a change in the rules can, by changing the meaning of sentences, change the truth of a priori propositions expressed by them but cannot change the truth of empirical propositions. To put it informally, different geometries involve different truths but there is just one set of facts to determine the truth of propositions in botany. (It is as if language were a system of prices for a priori truths and of values for empirical truths.) Hence Logical Positivism rests crucially on the claim that a priori truths result from man-made rules which we can, in principle, change. All knowledge of the world can thus be expressed in synthetic statements, whose truth cannot be guaranteed a priori and must be established by observation and induction. Conversely, since any state of the world might have been different, analytic truths are not about the world. This is the point of saying that they depend on the meanings of their terms, are true by definition or, in a phrase to be discussed in Chapter 6, are 'true by convention'. A bold and complete distinction has been drawn between language and fact, between pure theories and hypotheses, between what we invent and what we must discover, between a priori and empirical knowledge. Analytic and synthetic truths have a different sort of subject matter and statements of causal laws belong strictly among those which are for observation and induction. Synthetic statements are refutable. We can summarise Logical Positivism by adding four further tenets to our list: (iii) all cognitively meaningful statements are either analytic or synthetic but not both; (iv) synthetic statements, being refutable, cannot be known true a priori', (v) analytic statements have no factual content; (vi) analytic truths are true by convention. Positivism in its earlier days had hesitated about the place of logic and mathematics in empirical science. Logical and mathematical truths are part of our stock of knowledge but, being irrefutable in principle, cannot convincingly be seen as empirical generalisations. Logical Positivism removed the hesitation by dubbing all such truths analytic, as just described. By the same token, there should no longer be a puzzle about the role of theory in science. The term 'theory' has various uses but, with the help of the analytic-synthetic distinction, we should be able to reduce them to two. A 'theory' may be what we have just called a 'pure theory', in which case it serves to transform synthetic statements about data into synthetic predictions. (For instance, the theory of Exchange-rate Adjustment turns statements of the current balance of trade and other indicators into predictions of the results of a devaluation.) Or 'theory' may be a synonym for 'hypothesis' or the name of a set of hypotheses, in which case theoretical statements are synthetic. There is no mystery here, so long as we do not confuse the two uses, and what is called theory often includes both kinds of statement. This reflects the fact that the Positivist method of science is partly deductive, in that deduction helps to prepare hypotheses for testing and to interpret the results of the tests. We are thus led to ground which economists will find familiar, the famous hypothetico-deductive method, best illustrated with a diagram. Figure i is taken from R. G. Lipsey's Introduction to Positive Economics (3rd ed., Harper and Row, 1972), which presents a widely-held point of view with striking clarity.5 Figure 1 includes some pointers to the discussion in later chapters. Definitions and hypotheses are grouped together under the heading of 'assumptions'. 'Predictions' are equated with 'implications'. When the theory conflicts with the facts, there is apparently a choice of responses. A 'theory5 is presumably a set of assumptions and their implications. Fitting these methodological points into the context of Positivism, we get two further tenets: (vii) a known causal law is a well enough confirmed empirical hypothesis; (viii) the test of a theory is the success of its predictions. Finally there are two deliberate omissions. Value judgements are excluded and there is no mention whatever of economics in Figure 1. Value judgements are excluded in the spirit of the famous distinction between 'positive' and 'normative' statements, which is crucial to this view of science. 'Positive' statements are all those which a dispassionate observer could make while remaining ethically neutral. They can include facts about the ethical norms of the agents studied but must not add any ethical reckoning of those norms. 'Normative' statements are those explicitly or implicitly containing the word 'ought'. Admittedly this way of putting the distinction is less clear than it looks, since it lumps together the idea of moral judgement with that of evaluation of ends (as we shall see later when we discuss rationality), but for the present we are content to note its importance for Positive economics. There is no mention of economics in Figure 1 because, given the theory of knowledge already sketched, the Positivist method of science is bound to be a universal one. The difference between economics and, say, sociology or physics lies in their different subject matter and not in the method of scientific explanation which is applied. Taking these hints, we may add: (ix) judgements of value have no place in science; (x) sciences are distinguished by their subject matter and not by their methodology. We have now staked out our main philosophical target with ten tenets, which it may be as well to repeat: (i) claims to knowledge of the world can be justified only by experience; (ii) whatever is known by experience could have been otherwise; (iii) all cognitively meaningful statements are either analytic or synthetic but not both; (iv) synthetic statements, being refutable, cannot be known tr\\\\e a priori; (v) analytic statements have no factual content; (vi) analytic truths are true by convention; (vii) a known causal law is a well enough confirmed empirical hypothesis; (viii) the test of a theory is the success of its predictions; (ix) judgements of value have no place in science; (x) sciences are distinguished by their subject-matter and not by their methodology. We regard tenets (vii), (viii), (ix), (x) as defining a philosophy of science, which springs from Logical Positivism (iii), (iv), (v), (vi), which is a theory of knowledge in the empiricist tradition (i), (ii). This is our prime philosophical target (although we shall not neglect Pragmatism). To show that it is canonical, we cite Professor Samuelson: All sciences have the common task of describing and summarizing reality. Economics is no exception. There are no separate methodological problems that face the social scientist different in kind from those that face any other scientist ... Finally it is clear that no a priori empirical truths can exist in any field. If a thing has a priori irrefutable truth, it must lack factual content. It must be regarded as a meaningless proposition in the technical sense of modern philosophy.6\n",
      "\n",
      "The Inductive and Deductive problems Before laying our economic groundwork, we shall call attention to two key epistemological problems, facing all theories of knowledge, which form the philosophical theme of the book. One concerns Induction, the other Deduction. If these problems strike our economic readers as too gruellingly philosophical to be relevant to economics, we must again urge patience. We are convinced that philosophical definitions of the role of theory partly determine the kind of theory which an economist accepts. Indeed the most hard-headed economist is secretly a philosopher too. In later chapters we shall present our own solution to the Inductive and Deductive problems as an invitation to revise the usual role assigned to theory in economics and so to adopt other criteria of theoretical success. The Inductive problem has a general and a particular version. In general, why is a hypothesis strengthened by surviving the stages of Figure i (p. 9) and being lodged in the bottom left-hand oval? The stock answer is that what has happened in known cases will, ceteris paribus, happen in others. But how do we know that? It is a claim beyond the evidence of the senses alone and so is not sufficiently warranted by observation. Yet, if we claim to know it by induction, we beg the question, since previous observations count as evidence for the presence of future regularities in nature, only if we are already warranted in generalising from previous observations. And if we claim to know it a priori, then, according to positivists at least, it is true by definition and empty of all factual content. But, on the other hand, if we do not know that what holds in observed cases holds in others, then science is futile and any claim to have found a causal law falls at once. Nor can we escape by saying that science deals in probabilities rather than certainties, since there are no probabilities, unless we have inductive evidence that what holds in observed cases holds in others. We must be justified in projecting the sample into the population. If the world is about to become irregular, hypotheses are apparently not strengthened by passing the test. By Positivist canons, we cannot know a priori that there will not be different regularities or irregularities tomorrow. Do we know it at all? Perhaps the lack of known economic laws reflects an irregular economic world and the empirical science of economics is doomed to failure. The particular version strikes practical men with more force. Not all generalisations inspire the same confidence. Why are we warranted in adopting some and rejecting others? For instance, we accept it as a law that when a price rises, demand tends to fall, but do not accept that the rate of profit tends to remain constant at about 12%. Yet there is much evidence for the latter hypothesis, enough to warrant a claim to have found a law in more orthodox cases. Why does successful testing confirm the hypothesis that consumption rises when income rises but, apparently, not the hypothesis that in every developed country labour receives a constant share of the national income (about 40% in the U.S. and U.K.)? Furthermore, evidence, even when accepted, always points in more than one direction, and confirms several conflicting generalisations. What warrants adoption of one over another? Again, positivists cannot know a priori which criteria will be best in practice. And even a general solution to the problem of Induction may not yield a particular criterion, since, even if we know that past observation is a general guide, we need not yet know how to decide what it shows. (We shall argue later that the problems are inseparable; without a particular criterion there is no general solution.) The Deductive problem can be introduced with a dilemma about the place of pure theory in empirical science. Let us revert to Figure i (p. 9) and consider the relation between 'theory' 'logical deduction' 'definition' and 'hypothesis'. Presumably, in the spirit of Logical Positivism, definition and deduction contribute nothing on their own account to our knowledge of the world. Hypotheses, on the other hand, do contribute but only insofar as they are confirmed (and so, in general, only after the Inductive problem has been solved). The dilemma is whether a theory should be construed as a set of definitions and deductions from them or as a hypothesis (or set of related hypotheses). If a theory is a set of definitions and their consequences (such as the algorithms of maximising), then it consists of a set of analytic statements and so is, by the Positivist account, ultimately empty and optional. If it is a set of related hypotheses, economics is reduced to a wholly historical enquiry consisting of inductive generalisations, for which theorising, as the term is usually understood, provides no justification whatever, even if it helps in cutting corners. The reader will no doubt retort that a theory is a compound of analytic and synthetic, thus apparently escaping the dilemma. Certainly neither horn by itself looks comfortable. For instance, the Identification and Specification problems at least seem to demand both that more than inductive generalisation is to be used in judging the relevance and significance of data and that econometrics consist of more than optional definitions and their consequences. But the dilemma is not escaped by choosing both horns. If induction (and historicism in general) is not sufficient to yield the criteria of economic knowledge, then the addition of optional rules for transforming statements will not be sufficient either. The Deductive problem thus arises as soon as induction alone is found insufficient or, more subtly, as soon as deduction is given any epistemological part in solving the Inductive problem. It concerns the truths of logic, mathematics and other formal systems like kinship algebra or marginalist micro-economics and has two parts. The first is the nature of the necessity which marks such truths and how necessary truths are to be distinguished from others. The second is what, if anything, necessary truths have to do with matters of fact, how they can serve to describe a world which might have been otherwise and, if they do not have a descriptive function, what function they do have. For instance the Logical Theory of the Multiplier poses both aspects of the problem. Firstly, what sort of statements does it comprise, are they true and, if so, on what grounds? Secondly, how does the theory relate to the actual 'consequences of an expansion in the capitalgoods industries, which take gradual effect, subject to time lag...'? These are epistemological questions but, we shall argue, crucial ones for economic theory. Before passing on, we should perhaps indicate our own approach to the Inductive and Deductive problems. We shall argue in Chapters 6 and 7 that necessary truths are exactly what they seem, namely a priori truths vital to theorising, which states relations which must hold in the world market place. In other words we take the 'analytic' horn of the dilemma, arguing that theories are axiomatic systems on the geometrical model but denying that axiomatic systems are optional or empty. The axioms themselves, we then contend, are to be regarded as (putative) necessary truths and not as empirical assumptions or favoured hypotheses. Having thus claimed a truth for theoretical statements independent of the result of testing against experience and having rejected the logical positivists' account of necessary truths, we shall treat causal laws almost as if they were theorems in applied geometry. Our solution to the Inductive problem will be, in general, that without assumptions about continuity in the world scientific knowledge is impossible and, in particular, that a correlation is an instance of law only if there is a theoretical explanation of its significance. This approach will, we hope, lead to the rejection of some kinds of economic theory and the acceptance of others. But, since we must first overthrow some renowned theories of knowledge and then present our own, before arguing the merits of the approach, we shall withdraw into enigmatic silence for the time being. We suggest, in short, that economic theories are to be judged partly by whether they are backed by a suitable scientific method which is itself backed by a sound theory of knowledge, which has an answer to the Inductive and Deductive problems. This is not a matter of hunting round for philosophical support for specific economic theories. It has to do with the foundations of economic theory in general. Again with apologies to scholars (this time to historians of ideas), we propose to divide economic theory into two great main streams, one flowing from the pens of Marshall and Walras, the other from Ricardo and Marx. Admittedly Marshall deemed Walras' system impractical (and so shall we) and Ricardo's politics are closer to Marshall than to Marx. Analytically, nonetheless, Marshall and Walras conceived the economy in the same way, as a set of interrelated markets, in which households and firms meet as demanders and suppliers. Their key questions concerned the interaction of demand and supply with gains and losses for households or firms in changing conditions. Ricardo and Marx, on the other hand, saw the economy as based on methods of production, controlled and operated by one class but worked by another. Their key questions concerned the division of output between the classes as conditions changed. The two visions of the economic system differ in many important ways and we do not think that they can or should be reconciled. There are grounds for choosing between them and, we shall contend, the grounds are philosophical. In our view Positivist epistemology provides crucial support for the neo-Classical picture. Indeed one version of neo-Classicism, Positive economics, stands or falls with Positivism and we shall attack this influential textbook alliance without mercy. But we shall not thereby undo the whole of neo-Classicism and so shall then have to develop our own theory of knowledge, a version of Rationalism, in order to find conceptual failings in neo-Classicism. Then, in seeking an economic theory free of such failings, we shall find ourselves proposing a rudimentary version of the Classical-Marxian conceptual scheme. Now, however, with this strategy in mind, we owe the reader a more precise definition of the neo-Classical and Classical-Marxian systems and an indication of the differences between them. Neo-classical versus Classical-Maxian economics Empiricism, then, in its Positivist ramifications, supplies the general methodology of neo-Classicism, and we shall next explain what we understand by 'neo-Classicism'. (If our economic readers find what follows somewhat simple-minded, we remind them that philosophical readers probably will not and that we have therefore been content with a textbook account.) Figure 2, adapted from Samuelson and echoed in all major textbooks, shows what might be called a same-level division of society. Business and the public (producers and consumers), confront each other more or less as equals in the markets for both products and factors. (The equality is an overall one; there are some large or allied firms, some collective consumers.) Households demand final goods and services and supply the services of productive factors, in both cases in accord with what economists rather pompously call 'their given relative preference schedules', meaning what they like best. Businesses supply final goods and services according to their cost schedules in relation to the prices which consumers are prepared to pay, and demand the services of productive factors, according to their technical opportunites and needs in relation to consumer demand for products. So goods and services flow counter-clockwise, while money flows clockwise. In each set of markets, equivalents are traded for equivalents, the value of goods and services flowing in one direction being just matched by the stream of revenue in the other. No exploitation is possible in competitive equilibrium. The value of household factor supplies just matches aggregate household demand and the output of goods and services by business just matches the value of productive services which business demands. This may seem to ignore the fact that households save and businesses invest, meaning that some final demand flows not from the public but from business. But that is easily allowed for. To finance this demand, business must borrow household savings, by supplying bonds which the public demands. Bonds are treated as a kind of good, flowing counter-clockwise, while loans join the stream of money flowing clockwise. These points enable the microflow picture to be summed up as a macro-flow picture, illustrating in the simplest way how macro rests on micro foundations. It should also be clear that the market system adjusts so as to achieve the highest satisfaction possible for consumers, subject to the constraints of the technology and 'initial holdings' (meaning property arrangements). Business would be foolish to purchase factor services which are not needed, consumers to supply services for inadequate rewards. Thus factor services are all productive, in that they contribute to the efficient supply of goods which consumers demand and are offered voluntarily in the light of the reward they bring. Obvious objections to this ecpnomic schema can easily be raised, and the standard replies illustrate the role of Positivism as defender of the economic faith. For instance, not all 'households' are on a par, since some own all the firms between them, while the rest merely work for the firms. Also the distribution of profit and similar income is not an exchange, since the only 'service' which the owner of a business, in his capacity as owner, need supply in return for its profits is that of permitting it to be owned by him. (He does bear risks, of course, but so do the employees who will be out of their jobs in the event of failure.) Other objections were mentioned earlier; for example, that orthodox neo-Classicism ignores technological interdependences and institutional relationships, as the circular flow picture makes evident. Nowhere in it can one find social classes or any specific information about patterns of technical interdependence. All these objections look at first like strong empirical problems which neo- Classicists should meet head on. In fact, however, the customary orthodox defence is oblique and philosophical. To the charge that their model rests on unrealistic assumptions, they reply that the only test of a model is the success of its predictions. So there is no a priori error in making unrealistic assumptions. Moreover, 'simplifying assumptions' and 'theoretical constructs' are bound to be, in some sense, 'unrealistic' and there is no predicting without them. Unrealistic assumptions may therefore be warranted and the warrant is philosophical, Positivism itself. These defences will occupy us in the next few chapters. But now consider a quite different picture of capitalist society. Figure 3 epitomises the new approach, which, if the old is 'neo-ClassicaP, could be dubbed 'ClassicalMarxian'. It cannot be claimed that this is the only, or necessarily the best, distillation of an alternative picture from that tradition, but it will certainly serve to illustrate the contrasts.7 To keep the diagram comparable, we retain the circle for the final goods market and the box standing for industry, although we shall interpret both quite differently. 'Households' and the 'factor market' disappear altogether. Instead we have a pyramid, representing the social hierarchy, divided into two parts: a small upper class of owners and a large lower class of workers. Owners own industry and receive profits; workers work for industry and receive wages. Workers consume, but do not (in the simplified model) save; owners both consume and (save in order to) invest. Now consider the flows of goods and services and money payments. Labour is the only 'factor input'; other inputs are produced by industry itself, which is assumed to have access to land, mines, etc. (We are lumping landlords and capitalists together.) Hence we might expect to be able to value the total product in terms of labour, and although the mathematics is complicated, this can indeed be done, although not in all cases. The arrows running back and forth between factories represent inter-industry transactions, the exchanges between industries necessary to replace usedup means of production. The net social product is sold for total receipts, and consists of all goods over and above those needed for replacement. These can be divided (for convenience) into necessities, luxuries and new capital goods. Necessities go for worker consumption, luxuries for capitalist consumption, and new capital goods are installed in the factories in return for investment payments. Hence, the national accounts work out: Total receipts = net social product = wages + profits = wage consumption + capitalist consumption + investment demand = necessities + luxuries + new capital goods. There are striking differences between this and the neo- Classical diagram (Figure 2). The basic constituents of the neo-Classical vision are consumers and firms, whose optimising behaviour can be described with the aid of equations. The object is to predict such behaviour and its consequences, taking for granted the circumstances in which the behaviour occurs. The alternative vision, by contrast, begins by examining what neo-Classicism takes for granted. It is concerned with structure, with dependencies between institutions, with what makes for continuance or disintegration. Its basic constituents are industries, sectors, processes and activities, defined in technological terms. The constituents do not normally coincide with the neo-Classical 'decision-making* agencies.8 Nor is the object to predict what will happen. Instead the object is to arrive at a blueprint of the economic system which explains how the system responds to institutional changes. The blueprint is essentially an analysis of the nature of production and of the social relations surrounding production. Production, to the traditional neo-Classicist, is a 'one way street', running from 'primary5 factors to 'final products'. The primary factors are land, labour and, especially, capital, each receiving in competition a reward proportional to its 'contribution'. This involves a unified theory applying to all three factors, which nineteenth-century proponents of the Marginalist Revolution saw as its great achievement. The Classical-Marxian paradigm rejects the whole approach. 'Capital', for instance, is regarded as ambiguous between legal property in the means of production, which, being a homogeneous fund of value, can be embodied in different forms, and produced means of production or heterogeneous capital goods like tools, instruments, machines and plant, created and used by labour. 'Capital', as property, is relevant to the analysis of the distribution of income; 'capital', as goods, is relevant to the study of production; but there is no unitary stuff of 'capital' which helps to set the level of the rate of profit, since the amount of 'capital' as property depends on the price of 'capital' as goods, which depends in turn on an antecedent rate of profit. Once the role and indeed the nature of profit is called into question, other differences appear. In the neo-Classical vision profit is a payment (and a fair one when profits are 'normal') and wages plus profits are an exchange for the services of the factors of production, thereby providing a theory of the distribution of income. In the Classical-Marxian vision, distribution of income and exchange of goods are wholly different. Whereas wages as a whole are paid for work, profits as a whole are paid for nothing at all. Since payment of profit is not an exchange, there can be no equilibrium, in the usual sense, and no such thing as 'normal profit'. Nor are profit-based indicators the only or necessarily the best criteria for allocating investment, especially since what maximises growth need not maximise consumption. Correspondingly, the division of income, taken by neoClassicists as determined in the factor market by the marginal contribution of relatively scarce factors, is related in the Classical-Marxian vision to all aspects of the economy. Labour's share is given by the real wage times the amount of work and, as Keynes emphasises in his General Theory (Chapter 2), the real wage is the money wage divided by an index of consumer goods prices. The money wage is set in the labour market and prices in the final goods market. Labour's share thus depends on both markets and, moreover, influences consumer demand. Consequently the ClassicalMarxian economist claims to see and find crucial a host of interdependencies which play no part in neo-Classical analysis. Neo-Classical thinkers do not deny the existence of social hierarchy; they deny only that incorporating it in economics results in useful predictions. They regard J. B. Clark's strategy for collapsing the two aspects of 'capital5 into a single notion as a master-stroke which simplifies a hugely complex problem and reduces the theory of capital to a special case of price theory.9 The claim that profit is not paid in exchange for anything is, in their view, a disguised value judgement, a 'persuasive' redefinition of exchange. There is a capital market; the price of capital is a price like any other. Profit-based indicators may not be perfect but actual markets only approximate to those of pure theory. Naturally, the real wage depends upon all other prices; neo-Classicals have always insisted that all markets are interdependent. But the interdependence cannot be portrayed in a picture which ignores marginal productivity. We mention these differences (and there are many more) not to claim advantage for either vision but to make a philosophical point about the role of categories and concepts in theorising. Neither approach counts as a 'scientific hypothesis', by the Positivist definition of the term. For instance, in order to conduct a comparative test, an umpire would have to decide whether the payment of profits (rent, interest, etc.) is an exchange and this is a conceptual rather than (in the Positivist sense) empirical question. He would have to decide whether there is a basic social division into producers and consumers or whether the key concepts are those of hierarchy and class. Observation will not settle the point. No actual societies are as simple as these models, nor are actual institutions always easy to classify. Moreover each vision can accommodate the findings of the other, by assigning them a subordinate role. Many neo-Classical models include 'structural' relationships and many Classical-Marxian models include behavioural functions. But there remains a difference in emphasis, whose correctness cannot be judged, as we shall argue in later chapters, without making assumptions about the underlying correctness of one of the rival visions. Our point, then, is that the assumptions and categories of each theory are paradigmatic and fall outside the scope of empirical testing of rival consequences. But this takes us into water too deep for an introductory chapter and we must leave it here with a bald synopsis. Baldly, different philosophical strategies are involved. Neo-Classicists predicate behavioural functions of individual decision-makers, paying little attention to institutional detail, except where it can be expressed in behavioural functions (as in the imperfect competitor's downward-sloping demand curve or the kinked oligopoly demand curve); Classical and Marxian theorists base their equations on institutional structures and may use few behavioural equations. This reflects a difference in views about the nature of society and the individual. Neo-Classicists see behaviour characteristically as the outcome of maximising decisions; Classical and Marxian theorists find behaviour expressed (as with the classical savings function) in sociological data,10 and regard maximising as an instrument for deciding the best means to an end rather than as a description of what men do. This reflects a difference in philosophies of mind and theories of action. Neo-Classicists treat sound theory as the upshot of testing predictions with success; Classical and Marxian theorists insist that specifications and identifications be determined a priori by reflecting on what is essential to capitalist industrial institutions. This reflects a difference in epistemology.\n",

      "Summary and preview These are the alliances between philosophy and economics which we shall find at every turn. The first four chapters of the book will be concerned with that between Positivism and neo-Classicism. In Chapter i we ask why the failure of many neo-Classical predictions does not count as refuting neo-Classical theories and are met with a philosophical account of the function of ceteris paribus clauses. In Chapter 2 we suggest that neo-Classical theories are made viciously circular by the inclusion of maximising notions and are thus led to discuss the analytic-synthetic distinction. In Chapter 3 a query about the significance of an apparently constant capital-output ratio of 3:1 starts a debate about theories, hypotheses and induction. In Chapter 4 we find that, in attaching sense to terms like 'the price of a good', we must deny that facts are independent of theories. In each of these chapters, however, we reject the Positivist account and so, we hope, leave neo-Classicists without any coherent methodology or criteria of scientific merit. Chapters 5 to 9 survey the wreckage in a search for fresh criteria. In Chapter 5 we consider revealed preference theory as a philosophical thesis about the explanation of economic behaviour and suggest an analysis of the concept of action which favours linear programming models against revealed preference models. But the use of linear programming models needs to be backed by a fresh theory of knowledge and in Chapters 6 and 7, having rejected Pragmatism, we deploy our own solution to the problem of a priori knowledge. This yields the way of dealing with the Inductive and Deductive problems hinted at earlier and an axiomatic approach to theorising which favours programming and production models against predictive models. Finally, in Chapters 8 and 9 we claim philosophical merit for Classical-Marxian economics, coming as close as we dare to asserting, in the spirit of the axiomatic method, that economics is essentially about relations of production. We must again give warning that much has been sacrificed to clarity. Philosophically, in particular, we have confined our attention to Positivism, Pragmatism and an approach to epistemology which owes most to Leibniz and Kant. We have steered clear of much recent technical work in the philosophy of science by insisting on the primacy of unresolved epistemological issues. Our chapters on a priori knowledge show a reluctant disregard for many important complexities of a fascinating topic. Even so, we suspect that we have made life quite hard enough for the non-philosopher, just as non-economists may meet trouble with many passages which economists find irritatingly simple. Nevertheless we are convinced that philosophy matters to economics. Every scientific method has its metaphysics. Logical positivists used to report the death of metaphysics, but, as Mark Twain remarked on reading his own obituary in the newspapers one morning, the reports were exaggerated. We shall find metaphysical roots sustaining Positivism and so Positive economics. That is itself no fault (although positivists would presumably think it one) and our quarrel is with the nature of the metaphysics. We deny that the problems of methodology end when a philosophy of science has been propounded. The philosophy of science needs justification in its turn from a theory of knowledge. A theory of knowledge is, in our view, a general argument for general claims about what there is. This applies to Empiricism no less than to Rationalism and such general claims satisfy the logical positivists' definition of metaphysics. But such abstract reflections carry no weight unless they emerge from the dust of intellectual conflict. Let us therefore embark on our first problem, that of Relevance and Falsification.\n"
